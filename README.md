## Project Overview
This project focuses on uncovering the connection between employee performance and customer satisfaction through HR analytics. By analyzing data from customer reviews, support tickets, and employee feedback, we aim to identify how service quality impacts customer sentiment. We will extract key insights to help businesses enhance employee training, performance management, and overall customer experience using sentiment analysis and business intelligence tools.

## Problem Statement
The E-commerce business faces a significant challenge in understanding how employee performance affects customer satisfaction. Customer feedback is scattered across multiple platforms, making it difficult to extract HR-related insights. Poor service quality often leads to negative customer sentiment, but without proper analysis, businesses lack the data to improve workforce effectiveness. This project aims to bridge that gap by correlating customer feedback with HR metrics, providing actionable recommendations to enhance employee performance and, ultimately, customer experience.

## Data Sources
- Customer Feedback Platforms
- HR Stack - employee satisfaction feedback from HRIS system
- Support Tickets and Customer service interactions

## Methodology
This project follows a data-driven approach using:
- Microsoft Excel for data structuring
- Power BI for analysis and visualization
### Step 1
- Collected data from the review sites, support tickets,  and the HRIS system.
- Organised the data in Microsoft Excel and converted it to structured tables

### Step 2
- Transferred structured data from Excel to Power BI for further processing.
- Used power  query to clean filter and preprocess data by removing duplicates and irrelevant data.
- Standardized text formats.
- Handling missing values, using the conditional column and custom column function to add relevant data sets for insights.
  
### Step 3
- Carried out Data Modeling & DAX Calculations to measure key insights well represented on the dashboard
  
### Step 4
- Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key trends, including:
- Customer sentiment breakdown (positive, neutral, negative).
- Employee satisfaction impact on customer feedback.
- Patterns in service quality issues.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I explored the data source to answer the following key questions:
- What is the correlation between job satisfacction and customer feedback?
- Which employees or departments receive the highest/lowest customer satisfaction rating?
- Are their patterns in employee sentiment that align with csutomer feedback trends?
- Are there departments or job roles consistently receiving negative reviews?
- Does training hours show improved customer satisfaction?

## Key Insights
- High Rate of Negative Feedback: A significant portion of customers have expressed dissatisfaction with products and services, which could harm the organization's reputation and long-term customer retention.
- The overall satisfaction score is slightly below average, emphasizing the urgent need for improvementâ€”especially if the organization's goal is to maximize customer satisfaction.
- As the two most customer-facing departments, the high volume of negative feedback in Sales and Support suggests critical service issues that require immediate attention.
- The most common customer complaints include unresponsiveness, rudeness, poor communication, slow response times, and unhelpful service. These issues could stem from lack of proper customer service training, high employee workload, or employee dissatisfaction.
- Irregular work schedules may contribute to inconsistent service quality and lower customer satisfaction. Establishing clear, regulated work hours could help stabilize performance.
- High employee turnover in Sales could be contributing to inconsistent service quality and customer dissatisfaction.
- Given their leadership role, further investigation is needed to understand why account managers receive the lowest ratings and what can be done to improve their effectiveness.

## Recommendations
- Conduct a Root Cause Analysis on Negative Feedback Trends by gathering employee perspectives through surveys and focus groups to understand internal factors driving poor customer experience.
- The organisation should create an open-feedback culture where employees feel encouraged to share challenges, suggest improvements, and receive constructive feedback for professional growth.
- Monitor Customer Satisfaction Trends Regularly by implementing quarterly or yearly reviews of satisfaction trends and conducting segmentation analysis to track satisfaction across different customer groups and tailor business decisions accordingly.
- Enhance Training Programs for Customer-Facing Employees by shifting from generic training to scenario-based, soft skills training to improve real-world application. They should also evaluate current training effectiveness and adjust based on employee and customer feedback.
- Improve Communication & Response Time Efficiency by setting clear response time KPIs for customer service teams and implementing a ticketing system with priority levels for better issue resolution.They can also offer self-service options to reduce dependency on support teams for basic inquiries.
- Enhance Employee Engagement & Satisfaction by monitoring workload distribution to prevent burnout and inefficiencies and encouraging employee feedback mechanisms to identify workplace concerns early. They could also introduce an incentive program to recognize and reward excellent customer service.
- Standardize Work Hours to Improve Performance & Satisfaction: Establish regulated working hours to reduce employee fatigue and service inconsistencies.
- Assess & Align Company Culture with Internal & External Goals. Review how well the company culture supports employees in meeting service expectations and maintaining morale. 
- Implement Periodic Employee Sentiment Surveys: Conduct regular surveys to gauge employee morale, workload concerns, and job satisfaction trends.
- Overhaul Customer Service & Company-Wide Training Programs by redesigning the customer service training program to address key problem areas. The training initiatives should be expanded beyond customer-facing teams to improve overall organizational service quality.

## Conclusion
This analysis identifies key areas that influence customer satisfaction and employee performance. To enhance service quality, it is essential to address negative feedback, improve training effectiveness, and optimize workload management. The organization can elevate customer experience, employee engagement, and overall business performance by implementing data-driven strategies, fostering a culture of continuous feedback, and regular monitoring of trends.
